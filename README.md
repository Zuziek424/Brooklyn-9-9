# Brooklyn-9-9
## Brooklyn Nine-Nine Viewership Analysis

This is my assignment for the **Reproducible Research** course in the **Data Science and Business Analytics** program at the **University of Warsaw**. The goal of this project was to explore and visualize the viewership statistics of a TV series — I chose *Brooklyn Nine-Nine*, one of my favorites.

### What the Short Project Includes

- **A short description of the series** with its logo
- **Basic statistics** about viewership and trends over the years
- **Visualizations** showing average viewership per year and episode-to-episode changes
- Analysis of the highest and lowest viewed episodes
- Final **clean versions of the report** in both `.html` and `.pdf` formats (with hidden code)

### Files

- `brooklyn_99_report.ipynb` – main notebook with all analysis
- `brooklyn_99_report.html` – nicely rendered HTML version (code hidden)
- `brooklyn_99_report.pdf` – presentation-ready PDF (code hidden)
- `Brooklyn_99_Viewership_Data.csv` – episode-level dataset (parsed from Wikipedia)
- `brooklyn-99-poster.webp` – series poster used in the report

### Notes

- The `.ipynb` shows all steps and code used to generate the output.
- The `.html` and `.pdf` versions are clean, readable, and hide the code (only output and summaries are visible).
